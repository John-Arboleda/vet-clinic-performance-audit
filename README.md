# Vet-Clinic-Database-Performance-Audit

In this project, slow queries from the vet-clinic database were optimized.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

Use vet-clinic.sql to create all tables.

Use data.sql to populate tables with sample data.

Check solutions.sql for the queries that were requested, and their implemented solutions. Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!
